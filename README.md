Amaterasu is a powerful, configurable and multipurpose Discord bot, made using the Discord.js library for the Discord API. 
Please ensure you read the section regarding self-hosting and portability in this README document.

Made by [Thai Duong Vu](https://github.com/kaguwuya).  

## Commands
A variety of commands can be found in Amaterasu, ranging from system functions to fun commands. Amaterasu currently has over 100 commands, with many more planned for future releases.

## Music
Amaterasu boasts an advanced music system, with commands and features to make your listening experience as enjoyable as possible, through having a system that's easy to use, yet full of useful functions, such as a built-in YouTube search function, to avoid having to always find the song's YouTube link, as well as a full queueing system.

## Moderation
Amaterasu comes with a full moderation system, with even more features currently being developed. Commands will be written to be much more efficient and easy to use, as well as making them less error-prone.

## Open-Source
Amaterasu is an open-source project; which is why it can be found here, on GitHub. It is licensed under the MIT license. This bot is open source for the reason of allowing others view its code and learn from it, and also to gain inspiration for their own ideas. However, please do not directly copy entire chunks of code, as it may not work with your bot.
For further information regarding permissions, limitations and conditions of this project, please see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Amaterasu-Oomikami/Amaterasu/blob/master/LICENSE) file.

## Self-Hosting
**I currently do not support self-hosting Amaterasu.** This is due to the reason that it wasn't initially built for the purpose of being self-hostable, and also depends on various things (such as configs, settings databases, etc.) in order to be fully functional, which instructions for setting up are not stated here. Furthermore, Amaterasu is still in-development, meaning some things may not work, and many things will be changing quite often, thus not being very suitable for self-hosting. Essentially, this project is open-source for educational purposes; so that people who are interested can see how everything works.

Full support for self-hosting may be added in a future update.
Obviously, you *are* free to clone this repository, for whatever reason you wish.
